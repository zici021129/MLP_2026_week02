    "In this workshop, we will work through a set of problems on dimensionality reduction -- a cannonical form of unsupervised learning. Within the machine learning pipeline, dimensionality reduction is an important tool, which can used in EDA to understand patterns in the data, feature engineering to create a low-dimensional representation of the inputs, and/or in the final phase when you are presenting and visualizing your solution.\n",

    "As usual, the worksheets will be completed in teams of 2-3, using **pair programming**, and we have provided cues to switch roles between driver and navigator. When completing worksheets:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- You will have tasks tagged by (CORE) and (EXTRA). \n",
    ">- Your primary aim is to complete the (CORE) components during the WS session, afterwards you can try to complete the (EXTRA) tasks for your self-learning process. \n",
    ">- Look for the 🏁 as cue to switch roles between driver and navigator.\n",
    ">- In some Exercises, you will see some beneficial hints at the bottom of questions.\n",
